# LITA_CAPSTONE_PROJECT

## PROJECT TITLE: Sales Data Of A Retail Store

### Project Overview
This project dives into the sales performance of a retail store, exploring trends across time, regions, and product categories to unlock actionable insights. We’re not just crunching numbers; we’re uncovering the story behind the data—highlighting which products and regions drive success, how sales change month-to-month, and what this means for the store’s future strategies. By answering key questions and surfacing patterns within the data, we aim to empower the store with clear, data-driven decisions and provide a fresh perspective on what fuels growth. This analysis doesn’t just report numbers; it reveals the narrative that shapes the business’s potential.

#### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel

  2. For Visualisation
   
- SQL
  1. For Queries

- Power BI
   1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Visualisation

   -GITHUB

  ### Skills/Concept demonstrated
  The following Power BI features were incoporated by
  1. DAX Function
  2. Quick Measures
  3. Filters

  ### Data Sourcing
  The dataset, titled LITA_Capstone_Dataset, was sourced from the LITA_Incubator LMS on Canvas. Initially, it was saved in an Excel workbook, where it was subsequently converted into a CSV file to facilitate seamless import into SQL. In Power BI, the data was accessed directly from the Excel workbook for further analysis and visualization. This dataset comprises two distinct sheets/tables, providing a structured foundation for in-depth analysis.

  1. SalesData with 50,001 rows and 7 columns
  2. CustomerData with 75,001 rows and 8 columns
 
 ### Data Transformation/Cleaning
"The data was meticulously cleaned and transformed using Power BI, ensuring both efficiency and precision in the process. [Screenshot of applied steps included] Each column was carefully reviewed, confirming that they were entirely valid, free from empty cells or errors. 

To enrich the dataset, I added three additional columns, all derived from the OrderDate field. 

First, I created a column labeled 'Order Months,' containing the month extracted in date format. Next, I isolated the year from the OrderDate column to generate an 'Order Year' column. Finally, I developed a 'Quarter' column, also formatted as a date, to capture the quarter of each order. These steps significantly enhanced the dataset’s analytical depth."

### Exploratory Data Analysis
 EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
 1. Top Selling Product
 2. Regional Performance
 3. Monthly Sales Trends

 ### Project Objective
 This Project was designed to address the following analysis goal:
 1. Sales Transaction in Each Region
 2. Highest Selling Product By Total Sales Values
 3. Total Revenue Per Product
 4. Monthly sales Total For The Current Year
 5. Top Five Customers by Total Purchase Amount
 6. Percentage Of Total Sales Contributed By Each Region
 7. Product With No Sales in Last Quarter

 ### Problem Statement
 1. Which of our Products makes the greatest profit and which product runs the store into loss
 2. What is the total sales made yearly since 2023? Has sales been on the increase since over the years?
 3.    Which Region Has the Highest sales and Which Region has the lowest sales.
