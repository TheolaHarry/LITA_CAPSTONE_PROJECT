# LITA_CAPSTONE_PROJECT

## PROJECT TITLE: Sales Data Of A Retail Store

### Project Overview
This project dives into the sales performance of a retail store, exploring trends across time, regions, and product categories to unlock actionable insights. We’re not just crunching numbers; we’re uncovering the story behind the data—highlighting which products and regions drive success, how sales change month-to-month, and what this means for the store’s future strategies. By answering key questions and surfacing patterns within the data, we aim to empower the store with clear, data-driven decisions and provide a fresh perspective on what fuels growth. This analysis doesn’t just report numbers; it reveals the narrative that shapes the business’s potential.

  ###### Data Sourcing
  The dataset, titled LITA_Capstone_Dataset, was sourced from the LITA_Incubator LMS on Canvas. Initially, it was saved in an Excel workbook, where it was subsequently converted into a CSV file to facilitate seamless import into SQL. In Power BI, the data was accessed directly from the Excel workbook for further analysis and visualization. This dataset comprises two distinct sheets/tables, providing a structured foundation for in-depth analysis.

  1. SalesData with 50,001 rows and 7 columns
  2. CustomerData with 75,001 rows and 8 columns
